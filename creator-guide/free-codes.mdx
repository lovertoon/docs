## Code Redemption

When readers use your code:
1. They enter the code on the purchase/redeem dialog
2. System validates the code
3. Content is unlocked (no coins spent)
4. Code usage is tracked

### What Readers See
- "Code accepted! Content unlocked."
- Access to the unlocked content
- No coin deduction

## Important Considerations

### Revenue Impact
- Free codes bypass coin purchases
- Use strategically, not excessively
- Balance promotion with monetization

### Code Security
- Codes are unique and time-limited
- Each user can use a code only once
- Expired codes cannot be extended

### Abuse Prevention
- Codes work once per user
- Time limits prevent ongoing abuse
- Monitor redemption patterns
