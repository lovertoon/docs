## Pricing Overview

As a creator, you have full control over chapter pricing:
- Set any price from 0 (free) to your maximum
- Different chapters can have different prices
- Change prices anytime (affects future purchases)

## Setting Prices

When creating or editing a chapter:
1. Find the **Amount** or **Price** field
2. Enter the coin amount (0 for free)
3. Save the chapter

## Pricing Strategies

### Hook Model
Make early chapters free, then charge for later ones:
- Chapters 1-3: Free
- Chapter 4+: Paid

<Info>
This is the most common and effective strategy for building an audience.
</Info>

### Premium Model
Charge for all chapters:
- Best for established creators
- Requires existing audience
- Higher per-reader revenue

### Freemium Model
Mix of free and paid throughout:
- Key chapters free (cliffhangers)
- Resolution chapters paid
- Creates urgency

### Value-Based Pricing
Price based on chapter content:
- Regular chapters: 3-5 coins
- Long chapters: 7-10 coins
- Special chapters: Higher price

## Suggested Price Ranges

| Content Type | Suggested Range |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Short chapters** | 2-5 coins |
| **Regular chapters** | 3-7 coins |
| **Long chapters** | 5-10 coins |
| **Special/Double chapters** | 8-15 coins |

<Note>
These are suggestions only. Test different prices to find what works for your audience.
</Note>

## Revenue Calculation

For each chapter purchase:
```
Reader pays: [Your Price] coins
Platform commission: ~15%
Your earnings: ~85% of coin value
```

Example at 5 coins:
- Reader pays: 5 coins (~฿4.45)
- You receive: ~฿3.78

## Changing Prices

### How to Change
1. Go to Comics > Select comic > Select chapter
2. Edit the chapter
3. Update the price
4. Save

### Important Notes
- Price changes apply to **new purchases only**
- Readers who already purchased keep their access
- Consider announcing price changes to your audience

  <Accordion title="Anchor Pricing">
    Show your regular price alongside any discounted price. Example: "Usually 10 coins, now 5!"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    Keep similar chapter lengths at similar prices. Readers appreciate predictability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Value Perception">
    Very low prices can signal low quality. Don't underprice your work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Round Numbers">
    Prices like 5 or 10 coins are easier for readers to process than 7 or 13.
