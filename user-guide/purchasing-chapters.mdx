Chapters requiring coins display:
- Coin icon with the price
- Lock indicator
- "Purchase" option when clicking

    - Chapter title and number
    - Price in coins
    - Your current coin balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Purchase">
    Click **Purchase** to unlock the chapter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Reading">
