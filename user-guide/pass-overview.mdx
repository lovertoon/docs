## What is PASS?

PASS is Lovertoon's subscription program that gives members exclusive benefits:
- **50% discount** on all Hot Story chapters
- Support your favorite creators
- Access to exclusive promotions

<Info>
PASS is different from coins. It doesn't unlock content directly but gives you discounts when purchasing with coins.

## Savings Example

Without PASS:
- 10 Hot Story chapters × 5 coins = 50 coins

With PASS:
- 10 Hot Story chapters × 2.5 coins = 25 coins
- **You save 25 coins!**

<Tip>
If you typically spend more than the PASS cost on Hot Story chapters per month, PASS pays for itself!
</Tip>

- **Profile page** - Shows active PASS with expiration
