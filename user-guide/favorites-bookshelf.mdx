## Favorites vs. Reading History

|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Save comics you want to follow | Track what you've read |
| **Manual Control** | You add/remove manually | Automatic tracking |
| **Content** | Full comics | Individual chapters |
| **Duration** | Permanent until removed | Recent activity |

<Tip>
Use favorites for comics you want to follow long-term, and rely on reading history to pick up where you left off.
