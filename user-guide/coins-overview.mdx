## What Are Coins?

Coins are Lovertoon's virtual currency used to:
- Unlock premium chapters
- Support your favorite creators
- Access exclusive content

<Info>
Coins are non-refundable and can only be used within the Lovertoon platform.
</Info>

## How the Coin System Works

### Purchasing Coins
Buy coin packages via Stripe payment using credit/debit cards. See [Top Up Coins](/user-guide/topup-coins) for details.

### Spending Coins
Use coins to purchase premium chapters. Once purchased, chapters are permanently unlocked on your account.

### Creator Revenue
When you purchase a chapter, the coins go to the creator (minus platform commission), allowing them to earn from their work.

## Coin Packages

Lovertoon offers various coin packages:

| Coins | Price (THB) | Best For |

<Note>
Actual prices and packages may vary. Check the [Top Up page](/topup) for current offerings.

Your coin balance is visible in:
- **Navigation bar** - Quick view next to your avatar
